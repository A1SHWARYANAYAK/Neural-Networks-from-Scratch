# Neural-Networks-from-Scratch

**About:**

This project provides a hands-on implementation of fundamental neural network architectures using PyTorch. It covers:

* **Linear and Logistic Regression:** Demonstrates how these classic algorithms can be represented as single-layer neural networks.
* **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP):** Builds a 3-layer MLP for image classification on the MNIST dataset.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**  
    * Implements the 2D convolution operation from scratch.
    * Shows how to learn a convolutional kernel for edge detection.
    * Implements the ResNet18 architecture for image classification.

This project is ideal for anyone learning about neural networks and wanting to gain a deeper understanding of their inner workings.

**Usage:**

1. **Synthetic Data Regression:** Run the code in section 1.1 to generate synthetic data and train a linear regression model.
2. **MNIST Classification:**
    * Run the code in section 1.2 to train a single-layer neural network for MNIST classification.
    * Run the code in section 2 to train a 3-layer MLP for MNIST classification.
3. **Convolutional Neural Networks:**
    * Run the code in section 3.1 to experiment with the `corr2d` function and understand the convolution operation.
    * Run the code in section 3.2 to learn a kernel for edge detection.
    * Run the code in section 3.3 to train the ResNet18 model on the MNIST dataset.

**Key Features:**

* **From Scratch Implementation:**  Provides a deeper understanding by implementing core components manually.
* **Multiple Architectures:** Covers a range of neural network architectures, from basic to advanced.
* **Clear Explanations:** Includes comments and explanations within the code to guide understanding.
* **Visualization:** Uses matplotlib to visualize training progress and results.
